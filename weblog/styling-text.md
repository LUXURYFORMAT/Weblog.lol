# Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, <sub>subscript</sub>, <sup>superscript</sup>, <mark>mark</mark>,  text in comment fields and `.md` files.

---

# This is a h1 tag

## This is a h2 tag

#### This is a h4 tag

---

_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

---

- Item 1
- Item 2
    - Item 2a
    - Item 2b

---

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
    1. Item 3a
    1. Item 3b

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

Syntax highlighting

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

---

Footnotes

Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.

---

Task Lists

- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

---

Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

---

Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear crossed out.

---

`#007FFF`
