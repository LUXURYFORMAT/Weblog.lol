### CSS

In CSS files:

- `#08F` and `#0088FF`

The difference between `#08F` and `#0088FF` is that #08f is a shorthand representation of the color #0088ff. The shorthand format uses a single digit for each color component (red, green, blue), and the full six-digit format expands each single digit to two digits, repeating the digit

`#08F` expands to `#0088FF` by duplicating the digits: `0` becomes `00`, `8` becomes `88`, and `F` becomes `FF`. This expands the shorthand notation to the standard six-digit hexadecimal color code.
